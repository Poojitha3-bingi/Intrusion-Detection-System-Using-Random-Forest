# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Random-Forest
This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the Random Forest algorithm to classify network traffic as normal or malicious. It uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and scikit-learn for building an efficient, accurate, and scalable detection model.
